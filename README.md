## Study Tips

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to move slowly and learn from your mistakes than to go quickly and need to re-learn later.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very effective way to learn programming.
- Practice Pair Programming: two people, one computer.
- Read the code out loud
- Take a look through the [HYF Study Tips](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/study-tips) for more inspiration

### Priorities

If you can't finish all the material in this repository, that's expected! Anything you don't finish now will always be waiting for you to review when you need it. These 3 emoji's will help you prioritize your study time and to measure your progress:

- ü•ö `:egg:` - Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll need for this module. You do not need to finish all of them but should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- üê£ `:hatching_chick:` - Do your best to start this material. you don't need to master it or finish it but getting the main idea will be helpful for taking the next steps.
- üê• `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the ü•ö's and started all the üê£'s? push yourself with these challenges.

### Hashtags

There's sooo many examples and exercises in this repository, it's easy to forget of what you still need to finish or what you want to review again. Luckily VSCode is really good at searching through folders of code.

You can write hashtags in your comments while you're studying, then search for those hashtags later so you don't miss anything. Here's some ideas:

- `// #not-done, still a few blanks left` - search for `#not-done` in VScode to find all the exercises you've started and not finished
- `// coercion is confusing, #review this again next week` - search for `#review` to find the files you need to study again
- ... anything goes! Find the hashtags that work for you

### Module Project Boards

If you create a fork of this repository you can open a project board in your fork to track your progress through the module. Just 3 columns can be enough: _Todo_, _Doing_, _Done_.

## About Programming

Software Development is a many layered skill. One way to break it down is to think of these layers:

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>
<br>

1. **Source Code**: _The basic literacy of programming_
   - Learning the key words (_vocabulary_) and syntax (_grammar_) for your programming language
   - Being able to read your code out loud, tracing it's execution as a computer would
   - Understanding what the developer wanted to say with their code
   - > **Welcome to JS** will focus on these skills\_
2. **Machine Instructions**: _The basic mechanics of programming_
   - Understanding the life-cycle of your program
   - Understand how the computer will interpret your source code to create a running program
   - Understand what about your code matters to the computer, and what matters to people
   - Fixing syntax errors that occur when you try to run your code
   - Predicting which lines of code will be executed in which order
   - Predicting how each line of code will change what is stored in program memory
   - Reading error messages & callstacks to fix fix semantic errors that occur when you run your code
   - > **Debugging** will focus on these skills\_
3. **Problem Solving & Algorithms**: _Breaking down large problems to be solved in small steps_
   - Understanding a coding challenge and being able to break it down in different ways
   - Determining which solution strategies are correct for which types of problems
   - Understanding how test cases are used to describe your solution strategy
   - Identifying the best language feature to use with your strategy
   - Reading test cases to understand how code is _supposed to_ behave
   - Using Test Cases to structure your solution design process (Test Driven Development)
   - Identifying and isolating mistakes in your code by reading failing test cases
   - Demonstrating your code does what you think it does by passing test cases
   - > _**Behavior, Strategy, Implementation** Module will focus on these skills_
4. **Software Design**: _Organizing smaller pieces of code into full software solutions_
   - All in good time ;)
   - > _Every module starting with **Separation of Concerns** will focus on these skills_

## Suggested Study

Helpful links, examples and exercises.

### Be the Computer

These two games are deceptively simple. You will be given pseudo-code and will need to follow the instructions the same way a computer would. Practicing this game will help you learn how to trace code, and prepare you for learning about program memory in the next module - Debugging.

### Just Enough JavaScript

In this module you will only learn a small part of what JavaScript has to offer. You will learn _just enough_ JavaScript to make small programs that process text and interact with users. Why just enough, and not a little more? Because reading and understanding program logic is more important than JavaScript, so why let the code get in the way?

### Tutorials

A selection of tutorial sites with interactive exercises, these tutorial will help you learn the JS Syntax you need to study the exercises in this repository. As you're setting your study plans and priorities, remember: [Just Enough JavaScript](./just-enough-javascript). These tutorials will each cover different topics in different orders and in different ways. Find the one that works for you:

### Exercises in this Repo

The exercises in this module focus on how to read and understand programs that interact with a user. These exercises are a few steps above what you are expected to write or easily understand, that's the idea! As a programmer you will spend more of your time reading, understanding and adjusting code than you will writing it. So why not start there?

- üê£ **[reading-programs](./reading-programs)**: Practice reading interactive programs. This includes identifying variables, tracing code like the computer, drawing on the code, and asking good questions.
- üê£ **[describing-programs](./describing-programs)**: Analyze programs in detail learning to explain what is happening on each line, and explaining how each line contributes to the program's overall behavior.
- üê• **[explorations](./explorations)**: Experiment with JS language features that interest you, try modifying the programs in this repo, or try writing your own. This folder is yours to explore JS and programming.
